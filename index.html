            <h1>JavaScript30 Challenge Solutions</h1>
            <p class="introduction">I completed the <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30 challenge from
                Wes Bos</a> starting June 3, 2019 and ending July 3, 2019.
                This was a lot of fun! A lot of the solutions that he presents in the videos are more like proof of
                concept apps rather than production-ready apps, so I tried to take each one and improve on it.
                I added in things like accessibility, mobile responsiveness, keyboard-only navigation, touch events,
                and other general improvements where I saw fit. I spent around 30 minutes to 2 hours on each one of
                these. There are most definitely improvements that could be made to each one of these, but the
                purpose was to explore various JS fundamentals as well as to try out some of the new experimental
                features that modern JavaScript has to offer, not to spend hours making each into a perfect app.
                It was a good exercise!</p>

                                keyup, and keypress. If using keydown, the event continues to fire multiple times if
                                the user holds the key down, so you need to be aware of that and account for that if
                                needed. I disabled the key after the initial keydown and then re-enabled it on keyup
                                to avoid the sound being played a million times.</p>

                                of the element, and 0% or 100% puts the origin at one of the ends.</p>

                            <p class="takeaways"><b>Takeaways: </b>Range and color input styles vary from browser to
                                browser, so be sure to test everywhere you plan on supporting. <code>element.dataset</code> is
                                supported in IE11+, but <code>element.getAttribute</code> is supported
                                everywhere. <code>filter</code> is a neat CSS property for applying various
                                graphical effects, but it's newer so it isn't supported in old browsers. If you are
                                using your mouse, the <code>change</code> event fires on range inputs when you've let
                                go (so on <code>mouseup</code>), but the <code>input</code> event fires anytime the
                                input changes, even while you are holding the click and dragging.</p>

                                like <code>querySelectorAll</code> return a collection of nodes (in this case, DOM
                                elements) in a <code>NodeList</code>, which is somewhat similar to an array but
                                doesn't have all the methods that the <code>Array</code> prototype does. For
                                example, you can't call <code>reduce</code> on a <code>NodeList</code>. You
                                first need to convert the <code>NodeList</code> to an array, which can be done
                                with <code>Array.from()</code>. <code>reduce()</code> is an efficient way to
                                combine a <code>map()</code> and <code>filter()</code> so that you don't have to
                                loop through the array twice.</p>

                                Transitions look even cooler when you use a cubic-bezier timing function. The
                                transitionend event is only helpful if you can avoid having the transition called
                                multiple times. For example, the panels grow and shrink in this demo, so unless
                                you disable the clicking during the transition, you can get into a weird state
                                if someone clicks multiple times. I solved the problem with CSS transitions alone,
                                and you can see if you click on a panel rapidly it is handled well. You can include
                                orientation specific CSS on mobile devices using media queries. In my case, I only
                                show the panels when the device is in landscape orientation.</p>

                                dropdowns take a lot of work to be accessible. They need to have proper ARIA roles
                                and attributes, they need to show hover and focus indicators, and they need to be
                                accessible for keyboard-only users.</p>

                                animations can be a nice touch to your website when done properly. When handling
                                scroll events (or any event that fires repeatedly over a short period of time),
                                you can choose to debounce or throttle your function so that it runs less
                                frequently. A debounced function sets up a timer that gets reset every time the
                                function is called, so your wrapped function only executes once the timer has been
                                able to fully run. A throttled function on the other hand simply limits how often
                                the wrapped function can be called and does not reset its internal timer when the
                                function is called repeatedly. For example, if you are listening to the scroll
                                event with a throttled function that is limited to run every 200ms, and you
                                scrolled non-stop for about one second, the throttled function would be called 5
                                times. A debounced function would have only been called once, 200ms after you had
                                stopped scrolling.</p>

                            <p class="takeaways"><b>Takeaways: </b>Numbers, strings, and booleans are passed by
                                copy (or by value). Arrays and objects are passed by reference, so you need to be
                                sure to actually make a copy of the array or object if you want to modify the copy
                                without also modifying the original. You can make copies of arrays with methods
                                like <code>slice</code>, <code>concat</code>, <code>Array.from</code>, or the
                                spread operator (<code>...</code>). You can make copies of objects with methods
                                like <code>Object.assign</code> or the spread operator (<code>...</code>). One
                                thing to note is that all these methods make shallow clones, meaning that they
                                only make copies one level deep. So if you have a deeply nested object, you make a
                                copy of it, and then you modify a value on the copied object that is on the second
                                level or deeper, it will also modify the value of the original object too.</p>

                                can be compared with operators like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. When doing

                                The <code>getUserMedia</code> API is relatively young and has gone through some
                                changes in the past few years, so you have to include quite a lot of fallback code
                                to handle things properly in older browsers. For
                                example, <code>navigator.getUserMedia</code> is now found
                                at <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia</code>, and this method returns a
                                Promise rather than using callbacks. To attach the media stream to the video
                                element, you used to be able to use <code>createObjectURL</code>, but that method
                                is being deprecated in favor of simply set the value of <code>video.srcObject</code> to
                                the media stream. In order to make this demo work on mobile devices, you also have
                                to set a few more attributes on the video
                                element: <code>muted</code>, <code>autoplay</code>, and <code>playsinline</code>. This

                            <p class="takeaways"><b>Takeaways: </b>Events bubble up the DOM by default, but you
                                can make then capture down the DOM by passing an option when adding your event
                                listener. When removing event listeners, you should be as specific as you can be,
                                so if you added an event listener with a method and some config options, you
                                should remove it with that same method and config options. If you stop the event
                                propagation, it stops being handled on the additional elements that it would have
                                normally bubbled up or captured down to. The <code>once</code> option is a new
                                option that allows you to have the event handler run just once and then remove
                                the event listener on that element so that it doesn't run again unless you re-add
                                the event listener again.</p>

                                timers is to calculate the amount of seconds left each tick based on the current
                                time and the start time rather than simply setting up a seconds variable that you
                                decrement by 1 each tick. This helps prevent issues that occur if the interval
                                is deprioritized by other process running in the event loop or if the user switches
                                to a different tab in their browser.</p>
