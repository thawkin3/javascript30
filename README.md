    Takeaways: Be sure to note the differences between keydown, keyup, and keypress. If using keydown, the event continues to fire multiple times if the user holds the key down, so you need to be aware of that and account for that if needed. I disabled the key after the initial keydown and then re-enabled it on keyup to avoid the sound being played a million times.

    Takeaways: `transform-origin` is useful for controlling where the transform takes place. The default is 50%, or in the middle of the element, and 0% or 100% puts the origin at one of the ends.
